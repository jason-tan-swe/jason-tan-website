This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

## Practices
When working on a ticket there are two practices:
1. Create a new branch then review + merge
2. Link the issue in your commit and close the issue
